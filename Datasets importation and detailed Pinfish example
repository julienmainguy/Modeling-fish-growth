## The importation of any but one of the 21 publicly-available datasets presented in Table 1 of the main text
## can be directly achieved once the "fishmethod" and "FSAdata" packages have been activated in R. Note that
## additional steps to remove some sampled fish may be required, which is the case for the three detailed examples
## presented in the main text (1) pinfish, (2) male black drums, and (3) female haddocks. Given that these three
## datasets are presented in more details, here are the additional code that were applied applied:

## Example 1: pinfish (Nelson 2002)

## The original pinfish dataset has 670 sampled males and females, as can be seen from using the headtail() function
## of "FSA" which shows the first and last three lines of this dataset:

headtail(pinfish)

## As indicated in Nelson (2002) and the Fig. 2

pinfish <- pinfish[which(pinfish$sl > 65),]


Summarize(sl ~ 1, data = pinfish)



##For the third example about female haddocks regarding the
## modeling of biphasic growth (Honsey et al. 2017), the original data can be downloaded from Dryad at:

## https://datadryad.org/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.vb957

## To facilitate the importation of this dataset into R, the same dataset has been made available here in a .txt 
## format in which *Season = SPRING*, *Year = 2015*, and *Sex = 2* (i.e., female), which corresponds to an information
## that is common to all sampled female haddocks, has been removed. This reduced dataset can be automatically
## imported into R from using the following url link and the read.delim() function

url <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/julienmainguy/Modeling-fish-growth/refs/heads/main/haddock.txt"
haddock <- read.delim(url)
